  Information theory provides a constructive criterion for setting up
  probability distributions on the basis of partial knowledge, and leads
  to a type of statistical inference which is called the maximum-entropy
  estimate. It is the least biased estimate possible on the given
  information; i.e., it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing
  information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of
  statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found
  that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of
  the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the
  maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical
  mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any
  physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental
  verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they
  still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the
  basis of the information available.
  It is concluded that statistical mechanics need not be regarded as a
  physical theory dependent for its validity on the truth of additional
  assumptions not contained in the laws of mechanics (such as
  ergodicity, metric transitivity, equal a priori probabilities, etc.).
  Furthermore, it is possible to maintain a sharp distinction between
  its physical and statistical aspects. The former consists only of the
  correct enumeration of the states of a system and their properties;
  the latter is a straightforward example of statistical inference.

## Introduction
THE recent appearance of a very comprehensive survey[^1] of past
attempts to justify the methods of statistical mechanics in terms of
mechanics, classical or quantum, has helped greatly, and at a very
opportune time, to emphasize the unsolved problems in this field.
Although the subject has been under development for many years, we still
do not have a complete and satisfactory theory, in the sense that there
is no line of argument proceeding from the laws of microscopic mechanics
to macroscopic phenomena, that is generally regarded by physicists as
convincing in all respects. Such an argument should (a) be free from
objection on mathematical grounds, (b) involve no additional arbitrary
assumptions, and (c) automatically include an explanation of
nonequilibrium conditions and irreversible processes as well as those of
conventional thermodynamics, since equilibrium thermodynamics is merely
an ideal limiting case of the behavior of matter.

It might appear that condition (b) is too severe, since we expect that a
physical theory will involve certain unproved assumptions, whose
consequences are deduced and compared with experiment. For example, in
the statistical mechanics of Gibbs there were several difficulties which
could not be understood in terms of classical mechanics, and before the
models which he constructed could be made to correspond to the observed
facts, it was necessary to incorporate into them additional restrictions
not contained in the laws of classical mechanics. First was the
"freezing up" of certain degrees of freedom, which caused the specific
heat of diatomic gases to be only $\frac{5}{7}$ of the expected value.
Secondly, the paradox regarding the entropy of combined systems, which
was resolved only by adoption of the generic instead of the specific
definition of phase, an assumption which seems impossible to justify in
terms of classical notions.[^3] Thirdly, in order to account for the
actual values of vapor pressures and equilibrium constants, an
additional assumption about a natural unit of volume $(h^{3N})$ of phase
space was needed. However, with the development of quantum mechanics the
originally arbitrary assumptions are now seen as necessary consequences
of the laws of physics. This suggests the possibility that we have now
reached a state where statistical mechanics is no longer dependent on
physical hypotheses, but may become merely an example of statistical
inference.

That the present may be an opportune time to re-examine these questions
is due to two recent developments. Statistical methods are being applied
to a variety of specific phenomena involving irreversible processes, and
the mathematical methods which have proven successful have not yet been
incorporated into the basic apparatus of statistical mechanics. In
addition, the development of information theory[^2] [^3] [^4] has been
felt by many people to be of great significance for statistical
mechanics, although the exact way in which it should be applied has
remained obscure. In this connection it is essential to note the
following. The mere fact that the same mathematical expression
$-\sum p_i \log p_i$ occurs both in statistical mechanics and in
information theory does not in itself establish any connection between
these fields. This can be done only by finding new viewpoints from which
thermodynamic entropy and information-theory entropy appear as the same
concept. In this paper we suggest a reinterpretation of statistical
mechanics which accomplishes this, so that information theory can be
applied to the problem of justification of statistical mechanics. We
shall be concerned with the prediction of equilibrium thermodynamic
properties, by an elementary treatment which involves only the
probabilities assigned to stationary states. Refinements obtainable by
use of the density matrix and discussion of irreversible processes will
be taken up in later papers.

Section 2 defines and establishes some of the elementary properties of
maximum-entropy inference, and in Secs. 3 and 4 the application to
statistical mechanics is discussed. The mathematical facts concerning
maximization of entropy, as given in Sec. 2, were pointed out long ago
by Gibbs. In the past, however, these properties were given the status
of side remarks not essential to the theory and not providing in
themselves any justification for the methods of statistical mechanics.
The feature which was missing has been supplied only recently by
Shannon[^4] in the demonstration that the expression for entropy has a
deeper meaning, quite independent of thermodynamics. This makes possible
a reversal of the usual line of reasoning in statistical mechanics.
Previously, one constructed a theory based on the equations of motion,
supplemented by additional hypotheses of ergodicity, metric
transitivity, or equal *a priori* probabilities, and the identification
of entropy was made only at the end, by comparison of the resulting
equations with the laws of phenomenological thermodynamics. Now,
however, we can take entropy as our starting concept, and the fact that
a probability distribution maximizes the entropy subject to certain
constraints becomes the essential fact which justifies use of that
distribution for inference.

The most important consequence of this reversal of viewpoint is not,
however, the conceptual and mathematical simplification which results.
In freeing the theory from its apparent dependence on physical
hypotheses of the above type, we make it possible to see statistical
mechanics in a much more general light. Its principles and mathematical
methods become available for treatment of many new physical problems.
Two examples are provided by the derivation of Siegert's "pressure
ensemble" and treatment of a nuclear polarization effect, in Sec. 5.
## Maximum-Entropy Estimates
The quantity $x$ is capable of assuming the discrete values $x_i$
($i=1, 2, \dots, n$). We are not given the corresponding probabilities
$p_i$; all we know is the expectation
value of the function $f(x)$:
$$
\langle f(x) \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i f(x_i).
$$

 On the basis of this
information, what is the expectation value of the function $g(x)$? At
first glance, the problem seems insoluble because the given information
is insufficient to determine the probabilities $p_i$. Equation (2-1) and
the normalization condition 
$$
\sum p_i = 1
$$
 would have to be
supplemented by ($n-2$) more conditions before $\langle g(x) \rangle$
could be found.[^5]

This problem of specification of probabilities in cases where little or
no information is available, is as old as the theory of probability.
Laplace's "Principle of Insufficient Reason" was an attempt to supply
a criterion of choice, in which one said that two events are to be
assigned equal probabilities if there is no reason to think otherwise.
However, except in cases where there is an evident element of symmetry
that clearly renders the events "equally possible," this assumption
may appear just as arbitrary as any other that might be made.

Furthermore, it has been very fertile in generating paradoxes in the
case of continuously variable random quantities,[^6] since intuitive
notions of "equally possible" are altered by a change of
variables.[^7] Since the time of Laplace, this way of formulating
problems has been largely abandoned, owing to the lack of any
constructive principle which would give us a reason for preferring one
probability distribution over another in cases where both agree equally
well with the available information.

For further discussion of this problem, one must recognize the fact that
probability theory has developed in two very different directions as
regards fundamental notions. The "objective" school of thought[^8] [^9]
regards the probability of an event as an objective property of that
event, always capable in principle of empirical measurement by
observation of frequency ratios in a random experiment. In calculating a
probability distribution the objectivist believes that he is making
predictions which are in principle verifiable in every detail, just as
are those of classical mechanics. The test of a good objective
probability distribution $p(x)$ is: does it correctly represent the
observable fluctuations of $x$?

On the other hand, the "subjective" school of thought[^10] [^11]
regards probabilities as expressions of human ignorance; the probability of an
event is merely a formal expression of our expectation that the event
will or did occur, based on whatever information is available. To the
subjectivist, the purpose of probability theory is to help us in forming
plausible conclusions in cases where there is not enough information
available to lead to certain conclusions; thus detailed verification is
not expected. The test of a good subjective probability distribution is:
does it correctly represent our state of knowledge as to the value of
$x$?

Although the theories of subjective and objective probability are
mathematically identical, the concepts themselves refuse to be united.
In the various statistical problems presented to us by physics, both
viewpoints are required. Needless controversy has resulted from attempts
to uphold one or the other in all cases. The subjective view is
evidently the broader one, since it is always possible to interpret
frequency ratios in this way; furthermore, the subjectivist will admit
as legitimate objects of inquiry many questions which the objectivist
considers meaningless. The problem posed at the beginning of this
section is of this type, and therefore in considering it we are
necessarily adopting the subjective point of view.

Just as in applied statistics the crux of a problem is often the
devising of some method of sampling that avoids bias, our problem is
that of finding a probability assignment which avoids bias, while
agreeing with whatever information is given. The great advance provided
by information theory lies in the discovery that there is a unique,
unambiguous criterion for the "amount of uncertainty" represented by a
discrete probability distribution, which agrees with our intuitive
notions that a broad distribution represents more uncertainty than does
a sharply peaked one, and satisfies all other conditions which make it
reasonable.[^4] In Appendix A we sketch Shannon's proof that the quantity
which is positive, which increases with increasing uncertainty, and is
additive for independent sources of uncertainty, is
$$
H(p_1, \dots, p_n) = -K \sum_i p_i \ln p_i,
$$
 where K is a positive
constant. Since this is just the expression for entropy as found in
statistical mechanics, it will be called the entropy of the probability
distribution $p_i$; henceforth we will consider the terms "entropy"
and "uncertainty" as synonymous.

It is now evident how to solve our problem; in making inferences on the
basis of partial information we must use that probability distribution
which has maximum entropy subject to whatever is known. This is the only
unbiased assignment we can make; to use any other would amount to
arbitrary assumption of information which by hypothesis we do not have.
To maximize (2-3) subject to the constraints (2-1) and (2-2), one
introduces Lagrangian multipliers $\lambda$, $\mu$, in the usual way,
and obtains the result 
$$
p_i = e^{-\lambda - \mu f(x_i)}.
$$

 The
constants $\lambda$, $\mu$ are determined by substituting into (2-1) and
(2-2). The result may be written in the form
$$
\langle f(x) \rangle = -\frac{\partial}{\partial\mu} \ln Z(\mu),
$$
$$
\lambda = \ln Z(\mu),
$$
 where 
$$
Z(\mu) = \sum_i e^{-\mu f(x_i)}
$$
 will
be called the partition function.

This may be generalized to any number of functions $f_r(x)$: given the
averages 
$$
\langle f_r(x) \rangle = \sum_i p_i f_r(x_i),
$$
 form the
partition function
$$
Z(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_m) = \sum_i \exp \{-[\lambda_1 f_1(x_i) + \dots + \lambda_m f_m(x_i)]\}.
$$

Then the maximum-entropy probability distribution is given by
$$
p_i = \exp \{-[\lambda_0 + \lambda_1 f_1(x_i) + \dots + \lambda_m f_m(x_i)]\},
$$
in which the constants are determined from
$$
\langle f_r(x) \rangle = -\frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda_r} \ln Z,
$$
$$
\lambda_0 = \ln Z.
$$

 The entropy of the distribution (2-10) then
reduces to
$$
S_{max} = \lambda_0 + \lambda_1 \langle f_1(x) \rangle + \dots + \lambda_m \langle f_m(x) \rangle,
$$
where the constant $K$ in (2-3) has been set equal to unity. The
variance of the distribution of $f_r(x)$ is found to be
$$
\Delta^2 f_r = \langle f_r^2 \rangle - \langle f_r \rangle^2 = -\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \lambda_r^2}(\ln Z).
$$

In addition to its dependence on $x$, the function $f_r$ may contain
other parameters $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots$, and it is easily shown
that the maximum-entropy estimates of the derivatives are given by
$$
\left\langle \frac{\partial f_r}{\partial \alpha_k} \right\rangle = -\frac{1}{\lambda_r} \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha_k} \ln Z.
$$

The principle of maximum entropy may be regarded as an extension of the
principle of insufficient reason (to which it reduces in case no
information is given except enumeration of the possibilities $x_i$),
with the following essential difference. The maximum-entropy
distribution may be asserted for the positive reason that it is uniquely
determined as the one which is maximally noncommittal with regard to
missing information, instead of the negative one that there was no
reason to think otherwise. Thus the concept of entropy supplies the
missing criterion of choice which Laplace needed to remove the apparent
arbitrariness of the principle of insufficient reason, and in addition
it shows precisely how this principle is to be modified in case there
are reasons for "thinking otherwise."

Mathematically, the maximum-entropy distribution has the important
property that no possibility is ignored; it assigns positive weight to
every situation that is not absolutely excluded by the given
information. This is quite similar in effect to an ergodic property. In
this connection it is interesting to note that prior to the work of
Shannon other information measures had been proposed[^12] [^13] and used in
statistical inference, although in a different way than in the present
paper. In particular, the quantity $-\sum p_i^2$ has many of the
qualitative properties of Shannon's information measure, and in many
cases leads to substantially the same results. However, it is much more
difficult to apply in practice. Conditional maxima of $-\sum p_i^2$
cannot be found by a stationary property involving Lagrangian
multipliers, because the distribution which makes this quantity
stationary subject to prescribed averages does not in general satisfy
the condition $p_i \ge 0$. A much more important reason for preferring
the Shannon measure is that it is the only one which satisfies the
condition of consistency represented by the composition law (Appendix
A). Therefore one expects that deductions made from any other
information measure, if carried far enough, will eventually lead to
contradictions.
## Application to Statistical Mechanics
It will be apparent from the equations in the preceding section that the
theory of maximum-entropy inference is identical in mathematical form
with the rules of calculation provided by statistical mechanics.

Specifically, let the energy levels of a system be
$$
E_i(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots),
$$
 where the external parameters
$\alpha_j$ may include the volume, strain tensor, applied electric or
magnetic fields, gravitational potential, etc. Then if we know only the
average energy $\langle E \rangle$, the maximum-entropy probabilities of
the levels $E_i$ are given by a special case of (2-10), which we
recognize as the Boltzmann distribution. This observation really
completes our derivation
^12^R. A. Fisher, Proc. Cambridge Phil. Soc. 22, 700 (1925).
^13^J. L. Doob, Trans. Am. Math. Soc. 39, 410 (1936).
of the conventional rules of statistical mechanics as an example of
statistical inference; the identification of temperature, free energy,
etc., proceeds in a familiar manner,[^14] with results summarized as
$$
\lambda_1 = (1/kT),
$$
$$
U-TS = F(T, \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots) = -kT \ln Z(T, \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots),
$$
$$
S = -\frac{\partial F}{\partial T} = -k \sum_i p_i \ln p_i,
$$
$$
\beta_i = kT \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha_i} \ln Z.
$$

 The
thermodynamic entropy is identical with the information-theory entropy
of the probability distribution except for the presence of Boltzmann's
constant.[^15] The "forces" $\beta_i$ include pressure, stress tensor,
electric or magnetic moment, etc., and Eqs. (3-2), (3-3), (3-4) then
give a complete description of the thermodynamic properties of the
system, in which the forces are given by special cases of (2-15); i.e.,
as maximum-entropy estimates of the derivatives
$\langle \partial E_i/\partial \alpha_k \rangle$.

In the above relations we have assumed the number of molecules of each
type to be fixed. Now let $n_1$ be the number of molecules of type 1,
$n_2$ the number of type 2, etc. If the $n_s$ are not known, then a
possible "state" of the system requires a specification of all the
$n_s$ as well as a particular energy level
$E_i(\alpha_k|n_1, n_2, \dots)$. If we are given the expectation values
$$
\langle E \rangle, \langle n_1 \rangle, \langle n_2 \rangle, \dots,
$$
then in order to make maximum-entropy inferences, we need to form,
according to (2-9), the partition function
$$
Z(\alpha_{k} \dots | \lambda_1, \lambda_2 \dots, \beta) = \sum_{n_1, n_2, \dots} \sum_i \exp \{-[\lambda_1 n_1 + \lambda_2 n_2 + \dots + \beta E_i(\alpha_k|n_s)]\},
$$
and the corresponding maximum-entropy distribution (2-10) is that of the
"quantum-mechanical grand canonical ensemble;" the Eqs. (2-11) fixing
the constants, are recognized as giving the relation between the
chemical potentials 
$$
\mu_s = -kT \lambda_s,
$$
 and the
$\langle n_s \rangle$:
$$
\langle n_s \rangle = \partial F/\partial \mu_s,
$$
 where the
free-energy function $F = -kT \lambda_0$, and $\lambda_0 = \ln Z$ is
called the "grand potential."^16^ Writing out (2-13) for this case and
rearranging, we have the usual expression
$$
F(T, \alpha_1, \alpha_2 \dots, \mu_1, \mu_2 \dots) = \langle E \rangle - TS + \mu_1 \langle n_1 \rangle + \mu_2 \langle n_2 \rangle + \dots.
$$

It is interesting to note the ease with which these rules of calculation
are set up when we make entropy the primitive concept. Conventional
arguments, which exploit all that is known about the laws of physics, in
particular the constants of the motion, lead to exactly the same
predictions that one obtains directly from maximizing the entropy. In
the light of information theory, this can be recognized as telling us a
simple but important fact: there is nothing in the general laws of
motion that can provide us with any additional information about the
state of a system beyond what we have obtained from measurement. This
refers to interpretation of the state of a system at time $t$ on the
basis of measurements carried out at time $t$. For predicting the course
of time-dependent phenomena, knowledge of the equations of motion is of
course needed. By restricting our attention to the prediction of
equilibrium properties as in the present paper, we are in effect
deciding at the outset that the only type of initial information allowed
will be values of quantities which are observed to be constant in time.
Any prior knowledge that these quantities would be constant (within
macroscopic experimental error) in consequence of the laws of physics,
is then redundant and cannot help us in assigning probabilities.

This principle has interesting consequences. Suppose that a
super-mathematician were to discover a new class of uniform integrals of
the motion, hitherto unsuspected. In view of the importance ascribed to
uniform integrals of the motion in conventional statistical mechanics,
and the assumed nonexistence of new ones, one might expect that our
equations would be completely changed by this development. This would
not be the case, however, unless we also supplemented our prediction
problem with new experimental data which provided us with some
information as to the likely values of these new constants. Even if we
had a clear proof that a system is not metrically transitive, we would
still have no rational basis for excluding any region of phase space
that is allowed by the information available to us. In its effect on our
ultimate predictions, this fact is equivalent to an ergodic hypothesis,
quite independently of whether physical systems are in fact ergodic.
This shows the great practical convenience of the subjective point of
view. If we were attempting to establish the probabilities of different
states in the
^14^E. Schrödinger, *Statistical Thermodynamics* (Cambridge University
Press, Cambridge, 1948).
^15^Boltzmann's constant may be regarded as a correction factor
necessitated by our custom of measuring temperature in arbitrary units
derived from the freezing and boiling points of water. Since the product
TS must have the dimensions of energy, the units in which entropy is
measured depend on those chosen for temperature. It would be convenient
in general arguments to define an "absolute cgs unit" of temperature
such that Boltzmann's constant is made equal to unity. Then entropy
would become dimensionless (as the considerations of Sec. 2 indicate it
should be), and the temperature would be equal to twice the average
energy per degree of freedom; it is, of course, just the "modulus"
$\Theta$ of Gibbs.

Company, New York, 1954), Chap. 7.
objective sense, questions of metric transitivity would be crucial, and
unless it could be shown that the system was metrically transitive, we
would not be able to find any solution at all. If we are content with
the more modest aim of finding subjective probabilities, metric
transitivity is irrelevant. Nevertheless, the subjective theory leads to
exactly the same predictions that one has attempted to justify in the
objective sense. The only place where subjective statistical mechanics
makes contact with the laws of physics is in the enumeration of the
different possible, mutually exclusive states in which the system might
be. Unless a new advance in knowledge affects this enumeration, it
cannot alter the equations which we use for inference.

If the subject were dropped at this point, however, it would remain very
difficult to understand why the above rules of calculation are so
uniformly successful in predicting the behavior of individual systems.
In stripping the statistical part of the argument to its bare
essentials, we have revealed how little content it really has; the
amount of information available in practical situations is so minute
that it alone could never suffice for making reliable predictions.
Without further conditions arising from the physical nature of
macroscopic systems, one would expect such great uncertainty in
prediction of quantities such as pressure that we would have no definite
theory which could be compared with experiments. It might also be
questioned whether it is not the most probable, rather than the average,
value over the maximum-entropy distribution that should be compared with
experiment, since the average might be the average of two peaks and
itself correspond to an impossible value.

It is well known that the answer to both of these questions lies in the
fact that for systems of very large number of degrees of freedom, the
probability distributions of the usual macroscopic quantities determined
from the equations above, possess a single extremely sharp peak which
includes practically all the "mass" of the distribution. Thus for all
practical purposes average, most probable, median, or any other type of
estimate are one and the same. It is instructive to see how, in spite of
the small amount of information given, maximum-entropy estimates of
certain functions $g(x)$ can approach practical certainty because of the
way the possible values of $x$ are distributed. We illustrate this by a
model in which the possible values $x_i$ are defined as follows: let $n$
be a non-negative integer, and $\epsilon$ a small positive number. Then
we take
$$
x_1^{n+1}=\epsilon, \quad x_{i+1}-x_i = \epsilon/x_i^n, \quad i=1, 2, \dots.
$$

According to this law, the $x_i$ increase without limit as
$i \to \infty$, but become closer together at a rate determined by $n$.
By choosing $\epsilon$ sufficiently small we can make the density of
points $x_i$ in the neighborhood of any particular value of $x$ as high
as we please, and therefore for a continuous function $f(x)$ we can
approximate a sum as closely as we please by an integral taken over a
corresponding range of values of $x$,
$$
\sum f(x_i) \to \int f(x) \rho(x) dx,
$$
 where, from (3-9), we have
$$
\rho(x) = x^n/\epsilon.
$$

 This approximation is not at all essential,
but it simplifies the mathematics.

Now consider the problem: (A) Given $\langle x \rangle$, estimate $x^2$.
Using our general rules, as developed in Sec. II, we first obtain the
partition function
$$
Z(\lambda) = \int_0^\infty \rho(x) e^{-\lambda x} dx = \frac{n!}{\epsilon \lambda^{n+1}},
$$
with $\lambda$ determined from (2-11),
$$
\langle x \rangle = -\frac{\partial}{\partial\lambda} \ln Z = \frac{n+1}{\lambda}.
$$

Then we find, for the maximum-entropy estimate of $x^2$,
$$
\langle x^2 \rangle_{\{\langle x \rangle\}} = Z^{-1} \int_0^\infty x^2 \rho(x) e^{-\lambda x} dx = \frac{n+2}{n+1} \langle x \rangle^2.
$$

Next we invert the problem: (B) Given $\langle x^2 \rangle$, estimate
$x$. The solution is
$$
Z(\lambda) = \int_0^\infty \rho(x) \exp(-\lambda x^2) dx = \frac{\pi^{1/2} n!}{2^{n+1} ((n/2)!) \epsilon \lambda^{\frac{1}{2}(n+1)}},
$$
$$
\langle x^2 \rangle = -\frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda} \ln Z = \frac{n+1}{2\lambda},
$$
$$
\langle x \rangle_{\{\langle x^2 \rangle\}} = Z^{-1} \int_0^\infty x \rho(x) \exp(-\lambda x^2) dx = \left( \frac{n+1}{2} \frac{(\frac{1}{2}n)!}{[(\frac{1}{2}(n+1))]!} \right) \langle x^2 \rangle^{\frac{1}{2}}.
$$

The solutions are plotted in Fig. 1 for the case $n=1$. The upper
"regression line" represents Eq. (3-10), and the lower one Eq. (3-11).
For other values of $n$, the slopes of the regression lines are plotted
in Fig. 2. As $n \to \infty$, both regression lines approach the line at
45$^\circ$, and thus for large $n$, there is for all practical purposes
a definite functional relationship between $\langle x \rangle$ and
$\langle x^2 \rangle$, independently of which one is considered
"given," and which one "estimated." Furthermore, as $n$ increases
the distributions become sharper; in problem (A) we find for the
variance of $x$,
$$
\langle x^2 \rangle - \langle x \rangle^2 = \langle x \rangle^2 / (n+1).
$$

estimate of either quantity given the expectation value of the other,

</figure>
Similar results hold in this model for the maximum-entropy estimate of
any sufficiently well-behaved function $g(x)$. If $g(x)$ can be expanded
in a power series in a sufficiently wide region about the point
$x=\langle x \rangle$, we obtain, using the distribution of problem A
above, the following expressions for the expectation value and variance
of $g$:
$$
\langle g(x) \rangle = g(\langle x \rangle) + g^{\prime\prime}(\langle x \rangle) \frac{\langle x \rangle^2}{2(n+1)} + O\left(\frac{1}{n^2}\right)
$$
$$
\Delta^2(g) = \langle g^2(x) \rangle - \langle g(x) \rangle^2 = [g^\prime(\langle x \rangle)]^2 \frac{\langle x \rangle^2}{n+1} + O\left(\frac{1}{n^2}\right)
$$

Conversely, a sufficient condition for $x$ to be well determined by
knowledge of $\langle g(x) \rangle$ is that $x$ be a sufficiently smooth
monotonic function of $g$. The apparent lack of symmetry, in that
reasoning from $\langle x \rangle$ to $g$ does not require monotonicity
of $g(x)$, is due to the fact that the distribution of possible values
has been specified in terms of $x$ rather than $g$.

As $n$ increases, the relative standard deviations of all sufficiently
well-behaved functions go down like $n^{-\frac{1}{2}}$; it is in this
way that definite laws of thermodynamics, essentially independent of the
type of information given, emerge from a statistical treatment that at
first appears incapable of giving reliable predictions. The parameter
$n$ is to be compared with the number of degrees of freedom of a
macroscopic system.
## Subjective and Objective Statistical Mechanics
Many of the propositions of statistical mechanics are capable of two
different interpretations. The Maxwellian distribution of velocities in
a gas is, on the one hand, the distribution that can be realized in the
greatest number of ways for a given total energy; on the other hand, it
is a well-verified experimental fact. Fluctuations in quantities such as
the density of a gas or the voltage across a resistor represent on the
one hand the uncertainty of our predictions, on the other a measurable
physical phenomenon. Entropy as a concept may be regarded as a measure
of our degree of ignorance as to the state of a system; on the other
hand, for equilibrium conditions it is an experimentally measurable
quantity, whose most important properties were first found empirically.
It is this last circumstance that is most often advanced as an argument
against the subjective interpretation of entropy.

The relation between maximum-entropy inference and experimental facts
may be clarified as follows. We frankly recognize that the probabilities
involved in prediction based on partial information can have only a
subjective significance, and that the situation cannot be altered by the
device of inventing a fictitious ensemble, even though this enables us
to give the probabilities a frequency interpretation. One might then ask
how such probabilities could be in any way relevant to the behavior of
actual physical systems. A good answer to this is Laplace's famous
remark that probability theory is nothing but "common sense reduced to
calculation." If we have little or no information relevant to a certain
question, common sense tells us that no strong conclusions either way
are justified. The same thing must happen in statistical inference, the
appearance of a broad probability distribution signifying the verdict,
"no definite conclusion." On the other hand, whenever the available
information is sufficient to justify fairly strong opinions,
maximum-entropy inference gives sharp probability distributions
indicating the favored alternative. Thus, the theory makes definite
predictions as to experimental behavior only when, and to the extent
that, it leads to sharp distributions.

When our distributions broaden, the predictions become indefinite and it
becomes less and less meaningful to speak of experimental verification.
As the available information decreases to zero, maximum-entropy
inference (as well as common sense) shades continuously into nonsense
and eventually becomes useless. Nevertheless, at each stage it still
represents the best that could have been done with the given
information.

Phenomena in which the predictions of statistical mechanics are well
verified experimentally are always those in which our probability
distributions, for the macroscopic quantities actually measured, have
enormously sharp peaks. But the process of maximum-

class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>.</figcaption>
</figure>
entropy inference is one in which we choose the broadest possible
probability distribution over the microscopic states, compatible with
the initial data. Evidently, such sharp distributions for macroscopic
quantities can emerge only if it is true that for each of the
overwhelming majority of those states to which appreciable weight is
assigned, we would have the same macroscopic behavior. We regard this,
not merely as an interesting side remark, but as the essential fact
without which statistical mechanics could have no experimental validity,
and indeed without which matter would have no definite macroscopic
properties, and experimental physics would be impossible. It is this
principle of "macroscopic uniformity" which provides the objective
content of the calculations, not the probabilities *per se*. Because of
it, the predictions of the theory are to a large extent independent of
the probability distributions over microstates. For example, if we
choose at random one out of each $10^{10^{10}}$ of the possible states
and arbitrarily assign zero probability to all the others, this would in
most cases have no discernible effect on the macroscopic predictions.
Consider now the case where the theory makes definite predictions and
they are not borne out by experiment. This situation cannot be explained
away by concluding that the initial information was not sufficient to
lead to the correct prediction; if that were the case the theory would
not have given a sharp distribution at all. The most reasonable
conclusion in this case is that the enumeration of the different
possible states (i.e., the part of the theory which involves our
knowledge of the laws of physics) was not correctly given. Thus,
*experimental proof that a definite prediction is incorrect gives
evidence of the existence of new laws of physics*. The failures of
classical statistical mechanics, and their resolution by quantum theory,
provide several examples of this phenomenon.

Although the principle of maximum-entropy inference appears capable of
handling most of the prediction problems of statistical mechanics, it is
to be noted that prediction is only one of the functions of statistical
mechanics. Equally important is the problem of interpretation; given
certain observed behavior of a system, what conclusions can we draw as
to the microscopic causes of that behavior? To treat this problem and
others like it, a different theory, which we may call objective
statistical mechanics, is needed. Considerable semantic confusion has
resulted from failure to distinguish between the prediction and
interpretation problems, and attempting to make a single formalism do
for both.

In the problem of interpretation, one will, of course, consider the
probabilities of different states in the objective sense; i.e., the
probability of state $n$ is the fraction of the time that the system
spends in state $n$. It is readily seen that one can never deduce the
objective probabilities of individual states from macroscopic
measurements. There will be a great number of different probability
assignments that are indistinguishable experimentally; very severe
unknown constraints on the possible states could exist. We see that,
although it is now a relevant question, metric transitivity is far from
necessary, either for justifying the rules of calculation used in
prediction, or for interpreting observed behavior. Bohm and Schützer[^17]
have come to similar conclusions on the basis of entirely different
arguments.
## Generalized Statistical Mechanics
In conventional statistical mechanics the energy plays a preferred role
among all dynamical quantities because it is conserved both in the time
development of isolated systems and in the interaction of different
systems. Since, however, the principles of maximum-entropy inference are
independent of any physical properties, it appears that in subjective
statistical mechanics all measurable quantities may be treated on the
same basis, subject to certain precautions. To exhibit this equivalence,
we return to the general problem of maximum-entropy inference of Sec. 2,
and consider the effect of a small change in the problem. Suppose we
vary the functions $f_k(x_i)$ whose expectation values are given, in an
arbitrary way; $\delta f_k(x_i)$ may be specified independently for each
value of $k$ and $i$. In addition we change the expectation values of
the $f_k$ in a manner independent of the $\delta f_k$; i.e., there is no
relation between $\delta \langle f_k \rangle$ and
$\langle \delta f_k \rangle$. We thus pass from one maximum-entropy
probability distribution to a slightly different one, the variations in
probabilities $\delta p_i$ and in the Lagrangian multipliers
$\delta \lambda_k$ being determined from the
$\delta \langle f_k \rangle$ and $\delta f_k(x_i)$ by the relations of
Sec. 2. How does this affect the entropy? The change in the partition
function (2-9) is given by
$$
\delta \lambda_0 = \delta \ln Z = -\sum_k [\delta \lambda_k \langle f_k \rangle + \lambda_k \langle \delta f_k \rangle],
$$
and therefore, using (2-13),
$$
\delta S = \sum_k \lambda_k [\delta \langle f_k \rangle - \langle \delta f_k \rangle] = \sum_k \lambda_k \delta Q_k.
$$

The quantity
$$
\delta Q_k = \delta \langle f_k \rangle - \langle \delta f_k \rangle
$$
provides a generalization of the notion of infinitesimal heat supplied
to the system, and might be called the "heat of the $k$th type." If
$f_k$ is the energy, $\delta Q_k$ is the heat in the ordinary sense. We
see that the Lagrangian multiplier $\lambda_k$ is the integrating factor
for the $k$th type of heat, and therefore it is possible to speak of the
$k$th type of temperature. However, we shall refer to $\lambda_k$ as the
quantity "statistically conjugate" to $f_k$, and use the terms
"heat" and "temperature" only in their conventional sense. Up to
this point, the theory is completely symmetrical with respect to all
quantities $f_k$.
^17^D. Bohm and W. Schützer, Nuovo cimento, Suppl. II, 1004 (1955).
In all the foregoing discussions, the idea has been implicit that the
$\langle f_k \rangle$ on which we base our probability distributions
represent the results of measurements of various quantities. If the
energy is included among the $f_k$, the resulting equations are
identical with those of conventional statistical mechanics. However, in
practice a measurement of energy is rarely part of the initial
information available; it is the temperature that is easily measurable.
In order to treat the experimental measurement of temperature from the
present point of view, it is necessary to consider not only the system
$\sigma_1$ under investigation, but also another system $\sigma_2$. We
introduce several definitions: A *heat bath* is a system $\sigma_2$ such
that (a) The separation of energy levels of $\sigma_2$ is much smaller
than any macroscopically measurable energy difference, so that the
possible energies $E_{2j}$ form, from the macroscopic point of view, a
continuum. (b) The entropy $S_2$ of the maximum-entropy probability
distribution for given $\langle E_2 \rangle$ is a definite monotonic
function of $\langle E_2 \rangle$; i.e., $\sigma_2$ contains no
"mechanical parameters" which can be varied independently of its
energy. (c) $\sigma_2$ can be placed in interaction with another system
$\sigma_1$ in such a way that only energy can be transferred between
them (i.e., no mass, momentum, etc.), and in the total energy
$E = E_1 + E_2 + E_{12}$, the interaction term $E_{12}$ is small
compared to either $E_1$ or $E_2$. This state of interaction will be
called *thermal contact*. A *thermometer* is a heat-bath $\sigma_2$
equipped with a pointer which reads its average energy. The scale is,
however, calibrated so as to give a number $T$, called the temperature,
defined by 
$$
1/T = dS_2/d \langle E_2 \rangle.
$$

 In a measurement of
temperature, we place the thermometer in thermal contact with the system
$\sigma_1$ of interest. We are now uncertain not only of the state of
the system $\sigma_1$ but also of the state of the thermometer
$\sigma_2$, and so in making inferences, we must find the
maximum-entropy probability distribution of the total system
$\Sigma = \sigma_1 + \sigma_2$, subject to the available information. A
state of $\Sigma$ is defined by specifying simultaneously a state $i$ of
$\sigma_1$ and a state $j$ of $\sigma_2$ to which we assign a
probability $p_{ij}$. Now however we have an additional piece of
information, of a type not previously considered; we know that the
interaction of $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ may allow transitions to take
place between states $(ij)$ and $(mn)$ if the total energy is conserved:
$$
E_{1i} + E_{2j} = E_{1m} + E_{2n}.
$$

 In the absence of detailed
knowledge of the matrix elements of $E_{12}$ responsible for these
transitions (which in practice is never available), we have no rational
basis for excluding the possibility of any transition of this type.
Therefore all states of $\Sigma$ having a given total energy must be
considered equivalent; the probability $p_{ij}$ in its dependence on
energy may contain only $(E_{1i}+E_{2j})$, not $E_{1i}$ and $E_{2j}$
separately.[^18] Therefore, the maximum-entropy probability distribution,
based on knowledge of $\langle E_2 \rangle$ and the conservation of
energy, is associated with the partition function
$$
Z(\lambda) = \sum_{ij} \exp[-\lambda(E_{1i}+E_{2j})] = Z_1(\lambda) Z_2(\lambda),
$$
which factors into separate partition functions for the two systems
$$
Z_1(\lambda) = \sum_i \exp(-\lambda E_{1i}), \quad Z_2(\lambda) = \sum_j \exp(-\lambda E_{2j}),
$$
with $\lambda$ determined as before by
$$
\langle E_2 \rangle = -\frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda} \ln Z_2(\lambda);
$$
or, solving for $\lambda$ by use of (2-13), we find that the quantity
statistically conjugate to the energy is the reciprocal temperature:
$$
\lambda = dS_2/d \langle E_2 \rangle = 1/T.
$$

 More generally, this
factorization is always possible if the information available consists
of certain properties of $\sigma_1$ by itself and certain properties of
$\sigma_2$ by itself. The probability distribution then factors into two
independent distributions 
$$
p_{ij} = p_i(1) p_j(2),
$$
 and the total
entropy is additive: 
$$
S(\Sigma) = S_1 + S_2.
$$

 We conclude that the
function of the thermometer is merely to tell us what value of the
parameter $\lambda$ should be used in specifying the probability
distribution of system $\sigma_1$. Given this value and the above
factorization property, it is no longer necessary to consider the
properties of the thermometer in detail when incorporating temperature
measurements into our probability distributions; the mathematical
processes used in setting up probability distributions based on energy
or temperature measurements are exactly the same but only interpreted
differently.

It is clear that any quantity which can be interchanged between two
systems in such a way that the total amount is conserved, may be used in
place of energy in arguments of the above type, and the fundamental
symmetry of the theory with respect to such quantities is preserved.
Thus, we may define a "volume bath," "particle bath," "momentum
bath," etc., and the probability distribution which gives the most
unbiased representation of our knowledge of the state of a system is
obtained by the same mathematical procedure whether the available
information consists of a measurement of $\langle f_k \rangle$ or its
statistically conjugate quantity $\lambda_k$.
^18^This argument admittedly lacks rigor, which can be supplied only by
consideration of phase coherence properties between the various states
by means of the density matrix formalism. This, however, leads to the
result given.

We now give two elementary examples of the treatment of problems using
this generalized form of statistical mechanics.
*The pressure ensemble*.---Consider a gas with energy levels $E_i(V)$
dependent on the volume. If we are given macroscopic measurements of the
energy $\langle E \rangle$ and the volume $\langle V \rangle$, the
appropriate partition function is
$$
Z(\lambda, \mu) = \int_0^\infty dV \sum_i \exp[-\lambda E_i(V) - \mu V],
$$
where $\lambda, \mu$ are Lagrangian multipliers. A short calculation
shows that the pressure is given by
$$
P = -\langle \partial E_i(V)/\partial V \rangle = \mu/\lambda,
$$
 so
that the quantity statistically conjugate to the volume is
$$
\mu = \lambda P = P/kT.
$$

 Thus, when the available information
consists of either of the quantities $(T, \langle E \rangle)$, plus
either of the quantities $(P/T, \langle V \rangle)$, the probability
distribution which describes this information, without assuming anything
else, is proportional to
$$
\exp\left\{ - \frac{[E_i(V)+PV]}{kT} \right\}.
$$

 This is the
distribution of the "pressure ensemble" of Lewis and Siegert.^19^
*A nuclear polarization effect*.---Consider a macroscopic system which
consists of $\sigma_1$ (a nucleus with spin $I$), and $\sigma_2$ (the
rest of the system). The nuclear spin is very loosely coupled to its
environment, and they can exchange angular momentum in such a way that
the total amount is conserved; thus $\sigma_2$ is an angular momentum
bath. On the other hand they cannot exchange energy, since all states of
$\sigma_1$ have the same energy. Suppose we are given the temperature,
and in addition are told that the system $\sigma_2$ is rotating about a
certain axis, which we choose as the $z$ axis, with a macroscopically
measured angular velocity $\omega$. Does that provide any evidence for
expecting that the nuclear spin $I$ is polarized along the same axis?
Let $m_2$ be the angular momentum quantum number of $\sigma_2$, and
denote by $n$ all other quantum numbers necessary to specify a state of
$\sigma_2$. Then we form the partition function
$$
Z_2(\beta, \lambda) = \sum_{n,m_2} \exp[-\beta E_2(n, m_2) - \lambda m_2],
$$
where $\beta=1/kT$, and $\lambda$ is determined by
$$
\langle m_2 \rangle = -\frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda} \ln Z_2 = \frac{B \omega}{\hbar},
$$
where $B$ is the moment of inertia of $\sigma_2$. Then, our most
unbiased guess is that the rotation of the molecular surroundings should
produce on the average a nuclear polarization
$\langle m_1 \rangle = \langle I_z \rangle$, equal to the Brillouin
function
$$
\langle m_1 \rangle = -\frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda} \ln Z_1(\lambda),
$$
where 
$$
Z_1(\lambda) = \sum_{m=-I}^{I} e^{\lambda m}.
$$

 In the case
$I=\frac{1}{2}$, the polarization reduces to
$$
\langle m_1 \rangle = -\frac{1}{2}\tanh(\frac{1}{2}\lambda).
$$

 If the
angular velocity $\omega$ is small, (5-12) may be approximated by a
power series in $\lambda$:
$$
Z_2(\beta, \lambda) = Z_2(\beta, 0)[1-\lambda \langle m_2 \rangle_0 + \frac{1}{2}\lambda^2 \langle m_2^2 \rangle_0 + \dots],
$$
where $\langle \cdot \rangle_0$ stands for an expectation value in the
nonrotating state. In the absence of a magnetic field
$\langle m_2 \rangle_0 = 0$, $\hbar^2 \langle m_2^2 \rangle_0 = kTB$, so
that (5-13) reduces to 
$$
\lambda = -\hbar \omega / kT.
$$

 Thus, the
predicted polarization is just what would be produced by a magnetic
field of such strength that the Larmor frequency $\omega_L=\omega$. If
$|\lambda| \ll 1$, the result may be described by a "dragging
coefficient"
$$
\langle m_1 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2 I(I+1)}{3kTB} \langle m_2 \rangle.
$$

There is every reason to believe that this effect actually exists; it is
closely related to the Einstein-de Haas effect. It is especially
interesting that it can be predicted in some detail by a form of
statistical mechanics which does not involve the energy of the spin
system, and makes no reference to the mechanism causing the
polarization. As a numerical example, if a sample of water is rotated at
36 000 rpm, this should polarize the protons to the same extent as would
a magnetic field of about 1/7 gauss. This should be accessible to
experiment. A straightforward extension of these calculations would
reveal how the effect is modified by nuclear quadrupole coupling, in the
case of higher spin values.
## Conclusion
The essential point in the arguments presented above is that we accept
the von-Neumann-Shannon expression for entropy, very literally, as a
measure of the amount of uncertainty represented by a probability
distribution; thus entropy becomes the primitive concept with which we
work, more fundamental even than energy. If in addition we reinterpret
the prediction problem of statistical mechanics in the subjective sense,
we can derive the usual relations in a very elementary way without any
consideration of ensembles or appeal to the usual arguments concerning
ergodicity or equal *a priori* probabilities. The principles and
mathematical methods of statistical mechanics are seen to be of much
[^19]M. B. Lewis and A. J. F. Siegert, Phys. Rev. 101, 1227 (1956).
more general applicability than conventional arguments would lead one to
suppose. In the problem of prediction, the maximization of entropy is
not an application of a law of physics, but merely a method of reasoning
which ensures that no unconscious arbitrary assumptions have been
introduced.
## Appendix A. Entropy of a Probability Distribution {#appendix-a.-entropy-of-a-probability-distribution .unnumbered}
The variable $x$ can assume the discrete values $(x_1, \dots, x_n)$. Our
partial understanding of the processes which determine the value of $x$
can be represented by assigning corresponding probabilities
$(p_1, \dots, p_n)$. We ask, with Shannon,[^4] whether it is possible to
find any quantity $H(p_1, \dots, p_n)$ which measures in a unique way
the amount of uncertainty represented by this probability distribution.
It might at first seem very difficult to specify conditions for such a
measure which would ensure both uniqueness and consistency, to say
nothing of usefulness. Accordingly it is a very remarkable fact that the
most elementary conditions of consistency, amounting really to only one
composition law, already determines the function $H(p_1, \dots, p_n)$ to
within a constant factor. The three conditions are: (1) $H$ is a
continuous function of the $p_i$. (2) If all $p_i$ are equal, the
quantity $A(n) = H(1/n, \dots, 1/n)$ is a monotonic increasing function
of $n$. (3) The composition law. Instead of giving the probabilities of
the events $(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ directly, we might group the first $k$ of
them together as a single event, and give its probability
$w_1 = (p_1 + \dots + p_k)$; then the next $m$ possibilities are
assigned the total probability $w_2 = (p_{k+1} + \dots + p_{k+m})$, etc.
When this much has been specified, the amount of uncertainty as to the
composite events is $H(w_1, \dots, w_r)$. Then we give the conditional
probabilities $(p_1/w_1, \dots, p_k/w_1)$ of the ultimate events
$(x_1, \dots, x_k)$, given that the first composite event had occurred,
the conditional probabilities for the second composite event, and so on.
We arrive ultimately at the same state of knowledge as if the
$(p_1, \dots, p_n)$ had been given directly, therefore if our
information measure is to be consistent, we must obtain the same
ultimate uncertainty no matter how the choices were broken down in this
way. Thus, we must have
$$
H(p_1, \dots, p_n) = H(w_1, \dots, w_r) + w_1 H(p_1/w_1, \dots, p_k/w_1) + w_2 H(p_{k+1}/w_2, \dots, p_{k+m}/w_2) + \dots.
$$

The weighting factor $w_1$ appears in the second term because the
additional uncertainty $H(p_1/w_1, \dots, p_k/w_1)$ is encountered only
with probability $w_1$. For example,
$H(1/2, 1/3, 1/6) = H(1/2, 1/2) + \frac{1}{2} H(2/3, 1/3)$.

From condition (1), it is sufficient to determine $H$ for all rational
values 
$$
p_i = n_i / \sum n_i
$$
 with $n_i$ integers. But then condition
(3) implies that $H$ is determined already from the symmetrical
quantities $A(n)$. For we can regard a choice of one of the alternatives
$(x_1, \dots, x_m)$ as a first step in the choice of one of
$$
\sum_{i=1}^n n_i
$$
 equally likely alternatives, the second step of
which is also a choice between $n_i$ equally likely alternatives. As an
example, with $n=3$, we might choose $(n_1, n_2, n_3) = (3,4,2)$. For
this case the composition law becomes
$$
H\left(\frac{3}{9}, \frac{4}{9}, \frac{2}{9}\right) + \frac{3}{9}A(3) + \frac{4}{9}A(4) + \frac{2}{9}A(2) = A(9).
$$

In general, it could be written
$$
H(p_1, \dots, p_n) + \sum_i p_i A(n_i) = A(\sum_i n_i).
$$

 In
particular, we could choose all $n_i$ equal to $m$, whereupon (A-2)
reduces to 
$$
A(m)+A(n) = A(mn).
$$

 Evidently this is solved by setting
$$
A(n) = K \ln n,
$$
 where, by condition (2), $K>0$. For a proof that
(A-4) is the only solution of (A-3), we refer the reader to Shannon's
paper.^4^ Substituting (A-4) into (A-2), we have the desired result,
$$
H(p_1, \dots, p_n) = K \ln(\sum n_i) - K \sum p_i \ln n_i = -K \sum_i p_i \ln p_i.
